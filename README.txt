This project was a redesign of Tic Tac Toe to be played by four people. 
The rules of standard Tic-Tac-Toe were modified in order to allow more players while attempting to keep a similar feel to the original game. 
This game was programmed in c++ and used SFML for graphics. 

Each player places 2 pieces at a time. Takes 5 in a row to win.
