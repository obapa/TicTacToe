This project was a redesign of Tic Tac Toe to be played by four people. 
The rules of standard Tic-Tac-Toe were modified in order to allow more players while attempting to keep a similar feel to the original game. 
This game was programmed in c++ and used SFML for graphics. 
This game was enjoyable to program as was a helpful practice for learning SFML. 
This is an original game that I had came up with in 4th grade.
